To demo how an app requests permission, the base apk has to target android
framework 22 or below. On newer target frameworks app permission aren't requested on 
install, but on use (thinking back to 2017 security talks in Las Vegas, this
comes with its own issues ... another story).

Additionally apps compiled with latest build tools and android framework
couldn't be rebuild with apktool without error. See comments on inject-payload.sh
for details.
