============
Extended hotspot scripts for wifi security talk
this scripts run on standard kali machine and Galaxy S3 i9300 with modified SMDK4412 kernel and
nethunter 2.0 (sana) rootfs

Requierement
============
- installed mana-toolkit (modified hostapd)
- installed "dhcpd" (isn't default in newer kali rollin) --> $ apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
- if dhcpd errors out because of missing lease file: $ touch /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
- the wlan interface used for enabeling the hotspot MUSTN'T BE MANAGED BY NetworkManager
otherwise hostapd wouldn't be able to set it up, this could be achieved by editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
example:
----- begin NetworkManager.conf -------------------
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile

[ifupdown]
managed=false

#unmanaged devices here, identified per MAC address
[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=mac:00:c0:ca:82:1b:89
unmanaged-devices=mac:cc:7e:e7:59:49:6f
----- end NetworkManager.conf -------------------


Prerequisits for NETHUNTER (on Galaxy S3 i9300)
===========================
- setup.conf --> use_nethunter must be set to true
- /usr/lib/mana-toolkit/hostapd  has to be installed (with kali)
- to make captive portal work 'sudo' is needed, sudo works with suid-bit and thus the partition homing the sudo binary
must be mounted without "nosuid" --> for chroot kali of nethunter, which lives in /data/local/kali-armhf in android,
this means the /data partition has to be remounted before using this scripts. with the following steps
1) open Terminal
2) $ su
3) $ mount -o remount,rw /data
4) $ bootkali
5) cd to script path, run x.sh

- in order to make the script work with external wifi 'ALFA AWUS036NHA', external kernel modules need to be loaded
1) open Terminal
2) $ su
3) $ modprobe ath9k_htc
4) $ bootkali
5) $ ifconfig wlan1 up (internal wifi must be enabled before, otherwise ALFA module will be mapped to wlan0

REMARK: if script is configured to work with wlan0 as hotspot on nethunter (meaning hotspot is run on internal wifi)
the kernel module for internal wifi card is reloaded in accesspoint mode and some inteffering processes are killed,
to make wifi work again, device needs to be rebooted
Internal wifi is not capable of packet injection, thus hostapd doesn't work in karma mode (ext wifi needed for this).
Same goes for changing mac adress, internal wifi can't do this

Remark2: ettercap 0.8.2 has a bug which makes it crash running out of resources, this is fixed in version 0.8.3 which isn't
delivered with kali sana at time of creating this document

x.sh
=====
start menudriven access point

setup.conf
==========
settings for access point (net, name etc.)
